# Ragas Around The Clock

A simple one page react app which contains all my Spotify playlists with Indian classical music.
In Indian classical the so called Ragas are traditionally performed only at certain times of day.
The website automatically scrolls to the right list depending on what time it is.

Whenever I find new Ragas I keep on adding them to the lists.
